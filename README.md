Apple-themed Liquid Portfolio

This is a minimal, single-page portfolio scaffold that demonstrates a liquid, glassy display inspired by Apple's design language. It uses an SVG 'goo' filter and a handful of animated blobs to create a liquid effect.

How to run

- Option A: Open `index.html` directly in your browser (modern browsers recommended).
- Option B: Run a local static server (recommended for best results):

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

What you'll find

- `index.html` — main page
- `src/styles.css` — styling (glass, gradients, layout)
- `src/main.js` — blob animation logic

Next steps / ideas

- Add project thumbnails and case studies
- Replace placeholder copy with your real content
- Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Replace blobs with canvas/WebGL for richer liquid simulation
